  <p>Although social learning (the acquisition of specific behaviors by observing other individuals
exhibiting those behaviors ) is well documented among fish, few studies have investigated
social learning within a developmental context in these taxa. Rather than investigating the
development of a particular skill, Chapman, Ward, and Krause investigated the role of group
density during development in later foraging success in laboratory-housed guppies. When
raised with a small number of conspecifics (members of the same species), guppies were
quicker to locate food by following a trained adult guppy than were guppies raised in large
groups.</p>
  <p>This counterintuitive finding is explained by the fact that guppies reared in the highdensity
condition were less likely to shoal (swim in a group ) with others and, therefore, were
less likely to learn the benefits of social learning. Instead, fish reared in high-density situations
may learn that conspecifics are to be viewed as competitors, rather than as potential sources
of adaptive information. This finding suggests that at least for guppies, the early social
environment may have an effect on the capacity for social learning, if not on the socially
learned behaviors themselves.</p>
